# Final projects Stat 585

For the final project you are asked to work in a team with 3-5 members. 
Each team is asked to create an R package. You are free to choose package functionality, but there should be

- a minimum of five functions with a coherent theme,
- a shiny app show-casing some of the functionality
- a website for the package
- a README page with installation instructions and basic demonstration of functionality
- evidence of testing the functionality (e.g. show the code coverage)
- 8-10 page vignette detailing your work

You are asked to present your work as a team in one of the speaking slots during dead week and finals' week. Each team member is supposed to present for about 5 mins. 


Stage 1: Identify team and topic

Stage 2: Functional Package

Stage 3: Testing and Documentation 

Stage 4: Presentation (Dead week and Finals)

Stage 5: Package submission to canvas (Finals week)
